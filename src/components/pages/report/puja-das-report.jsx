                  <span class="text-style-1">After in depth analysis, </span>
                  After in depth analysis, we recorded that, your most pressing symptoms and concerns include brain fog and lack of attention, issues in concentration, body image concerns, body weight management is very difficult for you, loss of self esteem, disturbed sleep, poor nutrition and lifestyle habits,skin concerns and physical restrictions due to an implant in your spinal cord. You have a history of a really big emotional and physical event which is a big road accident some years ago that changed your overall health and wellness. <br/><br/>

                  Your BMI suggests immediate intervention with a proper nutrition plan supported with mental health therapy to help you overcome stress eating patterns. <br/><br/>

                  We suggest that we must do an in depth, specialized assessment of your skin, intimate and mental health to correlate and go to the root cause of having a possibility of a lifestyle or chronic condition.  <br/><br/>


                  Your mental health symptoms show that you have these regular moods generally including stress and overwhelmedness. You find it tough at times to stay motivated and have been feeling low self esteem. Your personal, professional and social life is getting impacted. You are showing physical symptoms as well like shortness of breath, sweating of your palms, sudden waking up from sleep, trembling fingers, tingling sensations, and anxiousness. You have a history of loss of consciousness and an attempt to a very low point in life where you tried to do self harm and was hospitalised. We are with you, Pinga will take care of you. <br/><br/>

                  Chronic fatigue and low motivation may be due to nutritional deficiency, poor body weight management and disturbed sleep cycle.  <br/><br/>
                    

                  By the way, stress releases cortisol and creates a vicious cycle of hormonal imbalance leading to many conditions including digestive issues, skin issues, hair loss, brain fog and irregular periods. <br/><br/>


                  About your gorgeous skin, you feel that you have complaints of pigmentation and dark patches all over your skin, excessive body hair and excessive facial hair, chronic acne in chest and face. <br/><br/>

                  As a working professional with less or no physical activity, a poor lifestyle causes stress to accumulate more. Give it a breather. <br/><br/>

                  Your family history shows thyroid concerns, hypertension, diabetes and neurological problems. <br/><br/>

                  Medication history and ongoing: You have taken birth control pills due to irregular periods earlier. You take antidepressants and anti anxiety pills as recorded by you. You also take sleeping pills on and off. <br/><br/>

                  You have reported high T4 levels, previously diagnosed with PCOS, spinal cord injury and implant, mental health treatment, treatment for skin and therapy.

                  <b>Puja</b>, Mental Health assessment shows that you have signs of a depressive state of mind. Depression or a depressive state of mind may show excessive worrying, extreme sadness with no apparent reasons, self doubt and feeling of worthlessness, feeling guilty, disturbances in sleep, a feeling of pleasure going out of your life and others. You have been feeling distrustful, cynical and extreme mood swings. Recurrent thoughts and urges bother you. You are showing signs of social isolation. <br/><br/>

                  Pinga highly recommends 6 or more therapy sessions to begin with.

            <h2>Recommendation from Session 01 </h2>
                Observation:
                <ul>
                  <li>

                  </li><li>

                  Self concept observed was extremely affected due to lack of exploration and excessive worry associated with her upcoming nuptials in December. Relationship issues focus on constant conflicts with the partner due to lack of proper communication and possible age gap. 
                  </li><li>

                  Diminished self confidence due to no nurturance in any other aspects of life other than the current romantic relationship
                  </li><li>
                  She was observed being extremely confused about self satisfaction and happiness (does not know what will make her happy)
                  </li><li>
                  Puja has a habit of carrying burden instead of speaking at the very moment. Reflection of moral policing with respect to family
                  </li><li>
                  Speech was coherent and fluent. Readily wants to work things out and declutter to make better decisions.

                </ul>


                Improvement plan and recommendation:

                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Partially going back to work
                  </li>
                  <li>

                <h2>Recommendation from Session 02: 08/06/2022</h2> 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  You were more forthcoming this time and opened up about communication issues with family and her partner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  You were observed feeling pressured of being married early and not being able to work on your career. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  You showed feelings of emotional exhaustion and depleting self confidence to push yourself forward to interact at home and with her partner about your feelings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  The daunting feeling due to frequent miscommunications with your partner has caused you to evaluate her relationship in a negative light.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Working towards your own happiness seems a far away concept that needs to be worked upon. You focus on pleasing your partner highly as a result of feeling in debt from being provided with support during an accident (traumatic event) were also observed.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>You were observed being heavily frustrated and helpless about your current situation.</li>
                  <li>
                  Repeated attempts to go back to work as informed by you during the session focused on you not being able to meet deadlines and not having faith in your own talent.

                  <li>
                  Lack of support system and not being able to express in front of the family is taking a heavy toll on your mental health.
                  </li>
                </ul>
